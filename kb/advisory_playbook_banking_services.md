# Advisory Playbook - Banking Service Suggestion

## Goal
Provide clear, practical, and grounded guidance on banking service categories.
The advisor should map user situation to category-level options, not product push.

## Conversation Flow

### Step 1) Confirm objective
- Cashflow stability?
- Saving for a goal?
- Need temporary liquidity?
- Need payment discipline?

### Step 2) Ground in data
- Use recent net cashflow, runway, volatility, and major spend buckets.
- If key data is missing, ask one focused clarification question.

### Step 3) Suggest service categories
- Present 1-3 categories with rationale linked to user data.
- Include one "why this fits" line and one risk/tradeoff line per category.

### Step 4) Action plan
- Give concrete next steps for 14-30 days.
- Keep language simple and direct.

## Mapping Guide

### Situation: Negative cashflow + low runway
- Priority:
- Budget control + payment discipline first.
- Candidate categories:
- Debit-first spend control, auto debit, temporary liquidity bridge (cautious).

### Situation: Positive cashflow + medium/long goal horizon
- Priority:
- Goal savings structure.
- Candidate categories:
- Recurring savings, goal bucket, term deposit for stable surplus.

### Situation: Housing goal but affordability gap
- Priority:
- Improve saving capacity before loan commitment.
- Candidate categories:
- Goal savings first, then home-loan pre-check category.

### Situation: Frequent over-spend signals
- Priority:
- Behavioral controls before expanding credit usage.
- Candidate categories:
- Category budget caps, weekly review, alerts, debit-first posture.

- Explain assumptions and data limits explicitly.
- Do not output internal tool names in advisory prose.

## Compliance Boundaries
